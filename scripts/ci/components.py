"""Insight coverage component registry — the single source of truth shared by
`coverage.py` (processes reports → per-component gate) and `changed.py` (emits
the CI matrix). Pure data + lookup: no CLI, no side effects, never runs tests.

Per component: name, lang, root (collection cwd), paths (repo-relative prefixes
for bucketing), plus per-language extras consumed by the CI producer jobs:
  rust   -> package (cargo package name); all_features (default True)
  python -> cov_package (the source_* package to measure)
  js     -> none (the package.json scripts under `root` carry the collection)

Nocode (declarative-YAML) connectors are excluded — no first-party code to
line-cover.
